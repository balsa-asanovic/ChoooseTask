# React SPA rendering data from JSON file

A small web app displaying tiles with pictures and other information fetched from json file.

I published the site at: https://soft-sorbet-e97f0d.netlify.app/ so feel free to check it out.

## Available Scripts

To run the project first run:

### `npm install`

And then:

### `npm start`

Which should run both the React app on port 3000 and JSON server on port 3001.

Current endpoint used is https://balsa-asanovic.github.io/db.json so the app hosted on Netlify could also fetch data.
If you are running the app on your environment and want to fetch the data directly from file db.json in the root folder replace the endpoint address with http://localhost:3001/tiles

### `npm test`

Launches the unit test suites.
